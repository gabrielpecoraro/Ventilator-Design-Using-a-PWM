## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing an **analog ventilator speed control system** using **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** and **analog electronics components**. The goal was to develop a working ventilator with speed control by creating a **custom PWM circuit**, an **integrator**, and an **amplifier** for precise motor regulation. A printed circuit board (PCB) was also designed and tested.

## Features
- **Custom PWM circuit** to control motor speed
- **Analog signal processing** with integrators and amplifiers
- **Free-wheeling diode protection** for motor safety
- **PCB design and implementation**
- **Tachometer integration** for real-time RPM measurement

## Required Software
To work with this project, the following software tools are needed:
- **Proteus** (for circuit simulations)
- **KiCad or Eagle** (for PCB design)
- **Multisim** (for additional circuit analysis)
- **Oscilloscope & Function Generator** (for practical validation)
